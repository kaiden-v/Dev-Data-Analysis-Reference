# Scikit-Learn Reference

## Introduction

Scikit-learn is a Python library for **machine learning and predictive modeling**. It provides simple and efficient tools for **supervised learning, unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and preprocessing**. Scikit-learn is built on top of **NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib**, and is designed to work seamlessly with **NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames**. This guide serves as a quick reference to the main features, processes, and functions of the Scikit-learn package. As this is a quick reference guide, more in-depth information can be found on the official [Scikit-learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) page.
