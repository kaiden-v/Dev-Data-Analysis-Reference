# Markdown Refernce

## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format plain text in a clean, readable, and portable way. It is widely used in GitHub repositories (READMEs, issues, documentation) and Jupyter notebooks (Markdown cells for explanations, math, and structure). This document is intended as a practical reference, not a full specification. It focuses on the Markdown features you will actually use when:
- writing project documentation
- explaining code and results
- structuring Jupyter notebooks
- creating clean, professional GitHub repositories
